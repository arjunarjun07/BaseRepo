# Best Practices
Language-Agnostic Design:

Follow the principles of modularity, separation of concerns, and scalability.
Document Everything:

Always include a README.md for the repository and README.md files in major subfolders for context.
Version Control:

Use .gitignore to exclude unnecessary files 

Environment-Specific Configs:
Use .env or environment-specific files for sensitive data.
